      <section id="footnote-*" class="hide-epp"><small>*</small> Available for Qualified Purchasers only. Qualified Purchasers receive an Apple&nbsp;Gift&nbsp;Card when they purchase an Eligible Product at a Qualifying Location through September 30, 2024. Gift card values may vary by Eligible Product. Only one Apple&nbsp;Gift&nbsp;Card per Eligible Product per Qualified Purchaser. Offer subject to availability. While supplies last. Qualified Purchasers shall receive a discount equal to the value of the Apple&nbsp;Gift&nbsp;Card off the price of the Eligible Product, but will be charged for all items in their cart, including the Apple&nbsp;Gift&nbsp;Card. Important notice regarding the checkout receipt and monthly statement for Apple&nbsp;Card Monthly Installments (ACMI) purchases with this promotion: Qualified Purchasers selecting ACMI (a 0% APR payment option available only in the U.S.) as payment type at checkout shall receive a discount equal to the value of the Apple&nbsp;Gift&nbsp;Card off the price of the Eligible Product. This will result in one ACMI installment plan over 12 months for the Eligible Product discounted by the instant credit, and a second ACMI installment plan over 12 months for the full price of the Apple&nbsp;Gift&nbsp;Card. The total combined amount charged over the two separate ACMI installment plans will reflect the original full retail price of the Eligible Product. Separately, Qualified Purchasers will receive and be charged for the Apple&nbsp;Gift&nbsp;Card in the amount of the applicable discount off the Eligible Product. Apple&nbsp;Card Monthly Installments (ACMI) is a 0% APR payment option that is only available if you select it at checkout in the U.S. for eligible products purchased at Apple&nbsp;Store locations, <a href="/">apple.com</a>, the Apple&nbsp;Store app, or by calling 1-800-MY-APPLE, and is subject to credit approval and credit limit. See <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT211204" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">support.apple.com/kb/HT211204</a> for more information about eligible products. APR ranges may vary based on when you accepted an Apple&nbsp;Card. Cardholders who accept an Apple&nbsp;Card on and or after August 1, 2024: Variable APRs for Apple&nbsp;Card, other than ACMI, range from 19.24% to 29.49% based on creditworthiness. Rates as of August 1, 2024. Existing cardholders: See your Customer Agreement for applicable rates and fee. If you buy an ACMI-eligible product by choosing to pay in full with Apple&nbsp;Card (instead of using ACMI), that purchase is subject to the Apple&nbsp;Card variable APR, not 0% APR. Taxes and shipping on ACMI purchases are subject to the variable APR, not 0% APR. When you buy an iPhone with ACMI, you’ll need to select AT&amp;T, T-Mobile, or Verizon as your carrier when you check out. An iPhone purchased with ACMI is always unlocked, so you can switch carriers at any time. ACMI is not available for purchases made online at the following special stores: Apple Employee Purchase Plan; participating corporate Employee Purchase Programs; Apple at Work for small businesses; Government and Veterans and Military Purchase Programs; or on refurbished devices. The last month’s payment for each product will be the product’s purchase price, less all other payments at the monthly payment amount. ACMI financing is subject to change at any time for any reason, including but not limited to installment term lengths and eligible products. See <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT211204" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">support.apple.com/kb/HT211204</a> for information about upcoming changes to ACMI financing. See the <a href="https://www.goldmansachs.com/terms-and-conditions/Apple-Card-Customer-Agreement.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Apple&nbsp;Card Customer Agreement</a> for more information about ACMI financing.
